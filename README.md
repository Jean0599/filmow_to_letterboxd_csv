# Filmow to Letterboxd - CSV Generator

### Creates CSV files (Letterboxd import format) with data from a Filmow profile.

> ### FEATURES
* You can choose between creating a "watched" file (jÃ¡ vi), a "watchlist" file (quero ver) or BOTH.

* You can also choose if you want to create a diary entry for each watched movie (it'll help if you want to log new diary entries in the future for rewatched movies)

* IMPORTANT: it will also import your **RATINGS** if you have them!

**Enjoy.**
